# gboy-remix
Remix of gmanmodz's gboy rev 3

All gerbers require 4LayerTech boards: may make new boards in the future to remove reliance.

Includes .stl files, gerbers, and a BOM
Included are KICAD files so anyone can edit them for their own project, as well as some footprints and symbols used to create mine.
Also inclued are fusion files for easy editing. No more .stl conversions.

BOM links are probably going to die.
